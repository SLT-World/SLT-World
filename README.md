I'm working actively on the SLBr Project, a fully featured, fast and clean web browser made using the powerful .NET WPF and using the fast Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) as the rendering engine. I'm the only developer and owner of the project.

Sometimes I make my projects open, sometimes not. I spend most of my time just thinking about what I can do to change my projects.
I'm doing all of this for a hobby.
